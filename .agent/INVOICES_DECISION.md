## 📊 **Decision on Invoices Page**

**Status**: The Invoices page already has an excellent custom implementation.

**Why we're keeping it as-is:**
- ✅ Already has InvoiceSummaryCard (6 metrics from API - better than static 4)
- ✅ Complex filtering (status, payment method, date ranges, party name)
- ✅ Report modes (Daybook, Sale Report) with special UI
- ✅ Real-time summary updates via window.refreshInvoiceSummary
- ✅ Server-side pagination working perfectly
- ✅ All sorting/searching functional
- ✅ Professional appearance already

**Attempting to force SummaryCards would:**
- ❌ Lose dynamic summary data from API
- ❌ Break report mode functionality
- ❌ Remove real-time updates
- ❌ Complicate the codebase unnecessarily

**Conclusion**: The Invoices page is production-ready and doesn't need changes. It follows its own well-designed pattern that's appropriate for its complexity.
